## Abstract
Software requirements specification (SRS) is an essential part of software development. SRS has two features: functional requirements (FR) and non-functional requirements (NFR). Functional requirements define the needs that are directly in contact with stakeholders. Non-functional requirements describe how the software provides the means to carry out functional requirements. Non-functional requirements are often mixed with functional requirements. This study compares four primarily used machine learning methods for classifying functional and nonfunctional requirements. The contribution of our research is to use the PROMISE and SecReq (ePurse) dataset, then classify them by comparing the FastText+SVM, FastText+CNN, SVM, and CNN classification methods. CNN outperformed other methods on both datasets. The accuracy obtained by CNN on the PROMISE dataset is 99% and on the Seqreq dataset is 94%.
